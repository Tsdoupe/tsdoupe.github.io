<h1>Tyler Doupe | ePortfolio </h1>
<p></p>  
<p> Welcome to my capstone ePortfolio associated with my Bachelor's in Computer Science at SNHU.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>    
<p>Self Assessment:</p>
<p></p>
<p>      The past two years have been a long trip for me! Without diving into the personal specifics of my life, a roller coaster of emotions is the lightest way to put what the past two years has been for me. I say that as I rode the roller coaster of life to get to this point where I am completing my Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science. Aside from the challenges I have faced in order to complete this degree, I have significantly deepened my technical knowledge in order to further shape my professional goals and aspirations. This degree program has taught me many new skills through rigorous course work, various skill application projects and ultimately instilled a new wealth of knowledge into me. This knowledge has already served to be vital in my current career as a Cyber Security Analyst as I often found myself referring to the work and skills I had gained throughout my coursework for this degree. I have quickly found ways to apply the knowledge learned from my previous line of work in the United States Navy and the new knowledge and skills I have gained from this degree to make me a vital team member at my current occupation. Overall, at a surface level, my skillset in software engineering, data structures, database management, team collaboration and security can speak for itself with the work presented in this artifact and many of the other projects I have completed in my GitHub repository. This capstone project specifically enabled me to grow my skills while designing a complete artifact that can demonstrate my readiness to enter a career field as a software developer.  
</p>
<p>      Throughout the entirety of this degree program, I have been given several opportunities already to apply the knowledge I gained to my current occupational role. For example, I have already exercised my skills with HTML to help design Splunk dashboards that help create an automated method of monitoring our site SIEM. I have assisted with resetting computers following the recent CrowdStrike update issue of 2024. I have provided assistance with updating the databases used at my occupation. These are just a few instances that I have already seen the knowledge gained from this degree program applicable to my current role. With this degree program being an online degree program, I have not had a ton of opportunities to deeply interact with other team members aside from the usual discussion forums that the degree program offers. I have collaborated with some classmates over duration of the course but it typically was not deeply involved or on a collaborative project effort. However, there has been one instance during this program where I have been required to work intricately with team members and that is seen in my GAM305Team repository. This collaborative construct has been unique as we were given an end goal of what we needed to complete but otherwise we had full control over what components or features we developed, how they were implemented into the project and the various sprints we completed as we deiced to approach the project in an Agile format. This project alone required the team to collaborate via multiple communication mediums, make use a test plan and traceability matrix, version control with Git and peer code review. This type of interaction taught me how to contribute in more than one way, technically and constructively. I was required to produce numerous components and features for the project while also providing guidance to team members on their respective assigned components while also ensuring the team stayed on track to meet our assigned end dates. In addition to my program work, serving in the Navy as a Cryptologic Warfare Officer taught me how to operate with a technical edge but in a constructive manner. My time in the Navy required that I learn a vital set of technical skills and knowledge in order to defend our country while also operating and applying a lot of the skills I learned in this program. The combination of both this degree program and my experiences in a team environment in the service have solidified my abilities to work in a collaborative team environment.
