<h1>Tyler Doupe | ePortfolio </h1>
  
<p> Welcome to my capstone ePortfolio associated with my Bachelor's in Computer Science at SNHU.</p>

<h2>Self Assessment:</h2>
<p></p>
<p>      The past two years have been a long trip for me! Without diving into the personal specifics of my life, a roller coaster of emotions is the lightest way to put what the past two years has been for me. I say that as I rode the roller coaster of life to get to this point where I am completing my Bachelor’s in Computer Science. Aside from the challenges I have faced in order to complete this degree, I have significantly deepened my technical knowledge in order to further shape my professional goals and aspirations. This degree program has taught me many new skills through rigorous course work, various skill application projects and ultimately instilled a new wealth of knowledge into me. This knowledge has already served to be vital in my current career as a Cyber Security Analyst as I often found myself referring to the work and skills I had gained throughout my coursework for this degree. I have quickly found ways to apply the knowledge learned from my previous line of work in the United States Navy and the new knowledge and skills I have gained from this degree to make me a vital team member at my current occupation. Overall, at a surface level, my skillset in software engineering, data structures, database management, team collaboration and security can speak for itself with the work presented in this artifact and many of the other projects I have completed in my GitHub repository. This capstone project specifically enabled me to grow my skills while designing a complete artifact that can demonstrate my readiness to enter a career field as a software developer.  
</p>
<p>      Throughout the entirety of this degree program, I have been given several opportunities already to apply the knowledge I gained to my current occupational role. For example, I have already exercised my skills with HTML to help design Splunk dashboards that help create an automated method of monitoring our site SIEM. I have assisted with resetting computers following the recent CrowdStrike update issue of 2024. I have provided assistance with updating the databases used at my occupation. These are just a few instances that I have already seen the knowledge gained from this degree program applicable to my current role. With this degree program being an online degree program, I have not had a ton of opportunities to deeply interact with other team members aside from the usual discussion forums that the degree program offers. I have collaborated with some classmates over duration of the course but it typically was not deeply involved or on a collaborative project effort. However, there has been one instance during this program where I have been required to work intricately with team members and that is seen in my GAM305Team repository. This collaborative construct has been unique as we were given an end goal of what we needed to complete but otherwise we had full control over what components or features we developed, how they were implemented into the project and the various sprints we completed as we deiced to approach the project in an Agile format. This project alone required the team to collaborate via multiple communication mediums, make use a test plan and traceability matrix, version control with Git and peer code review. This type of interaction taught me how to contribute in more than one way, technically and constructively. I was required to produce numerous components and features for the project while also providing guidance to team members on their respective assigned components while also ensuring the team stayed on track to meet our assigned end dates. In addition to my program work, serving in the Navy as a Cryptologic Warfare Officer taught me how to operate with a technical edge but in a constructive manner. My time in the Navy required that I learn a vital set of technical skills and knowledge in order to defend our country while also operating and applying a lot of the skills I learned in this program. The combination of both this degree program and my experiences in a team environment in the service have solidified my abilities to work in a collaborative team environment.  
</p>
<p>      Through this degree program, my time in the Navy and my current occupation, I have learned to effectively communicate with stakeholders. Whether this communication takes place over various communication mediums, through technical design documentation, wireframe and system diagrams, or strictly developing a slideshow brief to communicate, I have mastered this ability or skillset. The best example I can provide to demonstrate my mastery of this skill would fall back to my time in the service as part of my role was to serve as a support body for the National Security Agency. In this support role, my direct role was to serve as an outward facing liaison that coordinated technical documentation with high-ranking government officials, my internal team and high-ranking military leaders. This coordination led to me leading multiple teams of hundreds of people to design a technical outline for future development that was briefed to the Chairmen of Joint Chiefs of Staff. However, reflecting on this degree program specifically, I created and many wireframes, system diagrams and overall presentation reports that many can be found associated with the projects I completed in my GitHub repository. These wireframes, system diagrams and final reports demonstrate some of my more recent work that would demonstrate my abilities and skills to communicate effectively with a stakeholder as often the degree program outlined a scenario and part of the scenario was to design these products in order to communicate the vision with the client.
</p>
<p>      Reflecting on my skills associated with data structures and algorithms, this program has greatly deepened my knowledge and capabilities with numerous languages such as Java, C++ and Python in order to create professionally styled products. I have applied methods that enable a user to sort, search and traverse large datasets and have applied these methods to several projects found in my GitHub repository. Overall, the skills I have gained through this program, the projects that I have developed for both course work and personal, along with my outside work experience have taught me how to optimize code in line with industry best standards which will be required for any role I seek following this program completion.
</p>
<p>      Pertaining to software engineering and databases, my breadth of knowledge has vastly expanded from the program. Prior to this program, I had dabbled with database integration and web development but was very inexperienced. This degree program has significantly enhanced my skillset with software engineering and databases as I have implemented RESTful APIs, designed relational and non-relational schemas, applied MVC principles in web development using frameworks such as Angular and Node.js. I have worked the most with MongoDB and MySQL to manage data in previous course work and have worked with them in a manner to apply privileged access rights. The best example of this being demonstrated in my work is in the artifact found below that highlights my skillset in enhancing a Single Page Application (SPA).
</p>
<p>      Reflecting on my work in this program affiliated with security, it is easy to say I have grown a lot in this area. From my most recent artifact enhancement, it is clear that I possess a strong understanding of security principles and practices as I enhanced my SPA to feature secure authentication via JWT tokens. I included secure authentication in logging into the SPA and in some previous course work I had taken a deep dive into vulnerability assessment and adjudication. My current role as a cyber security analyst also required that I can review code to identify potential vulnerabilities and I must be capable of identifying new software vulnerabilities that need to be addressed for site equipment. The skills and knowledge from both my work and this degree program have prepared me to step into any role and hit the ground running, especially with security at the forefront of my thoughts.
</p>
<p>      Now moving forward with the artifact below, the artifact in my ePortfolio is a project I chose to enhance as I felt it would enable me the opportunity to demonstrate a large skill set that I have developed from this program. This singular artifact incorporates both front end and back-end technologies and techniques in order to create a functioning full stack web application. The artifact found in my ePortfolio ties together aspects of design and implementation as I needed to convert static HTML pages into a SPA which is extremely relevant in today’s society as many public facing interfaces look to transition into this modern approach. My artifact showcases my expertise in full-stack development, API communication, user authentication and database integration. It is not possible to have one artifact completely demonstrate every skill and bit of knowledge I possess but this singular artifact is capable of demonstrating a sizable amount of my knowledge and capabilities that I can bring to any company. 
</p>
<p>      In the end, this ePortfolio provides some light into the academic knowledge I have gained as I pursued this degree and demonstrates my professional capabilities. It highlights my values of code quality, scalability, reliability and security while also demonstrating my absorption of knowledge following the degree program. I am confident that my unique professional background, diverse knowledge wealth and relentless determination to improve every day will position me for success in any career within the computer science field!
